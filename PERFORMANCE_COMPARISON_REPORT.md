### 3. Dependency Injection Tests

#### Standard Dependency Test (`/dependency-test`)
| Metric | nginx + PHP-FPM | nginx + Octane | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Requests/sec** | 169.20 | **187.80** | **+11.0%** |
| **Response Time (Avg)** | 29.5ms | **26.6ms** | **-9.8%** |

#### Shared Dependency Test (`/shared-dependency-test`)
| Metric | nginx + PHP-FPM | nginx + Octane | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
